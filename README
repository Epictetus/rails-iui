rails_iui
========

A Rails wrapper around the iUI library for creating web applications.

This was originally created as a set of examples for some articles that should
be appearing soon. I'm releasing them as a plugin in the hope they'll be 
somewhat useful, even in their current partial state.

4-21-2008: Still functionally incomplete, and somewhat embarrassingly, without
automated tests.

Example
=======

The rails_iui plugin does three things.

A series of Rake tasks will download iUI and insert it in the current Rails
project, changing the image URLs in the CSS file to match the standard Rails
layout.

rake iui:install  #download and install
rake iui:install_compact #download and install the compact version of iui
rake iui:clean    #removes iui files

The module ActionController::IphoneController adds support for recognizing
Mobile Safari as the :iphone pseudo-MIME type.

In your controller (can be ApplicationController) add the line

acts_as_iphone_controller

And any respond_to block can include iphone as an option, looking for 
.iphone.erb files in the view directory. Passing the argument true, as in
acts_as_iphone_controller(true) turns on test mode, where all requests are
treated as iphone regardless of user agent string. This is useful for testing
in some of the iPhone simulators. You'll need to restart the server for test
mode changes to take effect.

In your views, several methods from the IuiHelper module are automatically
imported into your application and are available throughout.  

viewport_tag(options = {})
  Builds the Mobile Safari meta viewport tag, pass the option 
  :device_width => true to specify the options for applications optimized for
  iPhone. More options to come.

include_iui_files 
  Place in the header of your layout, includes the tags for the iUI CSS and
  JavaScript files. Also defines the $ function, as in prototype.

button_link_to(name, options, html_options = {})
  Creates a link with the iUI CSS class of "button"
 
link_to_replace(name, options, html_options = {}) 
  An iUI link which replaces the link tag with the result text. Designed to
  be used for an anchor inside a list

link_to_external(name, options, html_options = {}) 
  An iUI link to an external item, this is an regular HTTP request, as 
  opposed to what iUI normally does, which is an Ajax request

iui_toolbar(initial_caption, search_url = nil)
  Sets the toolbar -- the caption is the heading. If there is a search_url,
  then a search button is added to the right side

iui_list(items, options = {}) 
  Creates an iPhone style of list. The items are expected to respond to the
  methods :caption -- the text display for the list, and :url, the url to
  go to when the item is selected. The :top and :bottom options specify
  text to be displayed above or below the list items. The :more option 
  specifies an item to go at the end of the list as a link_to_replace. The
  :as_replace options sends the list items without a surrounding ul tag, to
  be the response to a link_to_replace.
  
iui_grouped_list(items, options = {}, &group_by_block)
  Same as iui_list, but groups each item by their response to the 
  group_by_block
